You remember that you need gas. Your car is at 1/4 tank. That is just enough to get you to the gas station then to the bank where you work. Would you rather go get gas then the bank or would you take the train to work? </h1>

They run in and yelled, "There's a Snake in my Boot!" You initally think that there is a problem but they were listening to music with Airpods. One of the women pull out a note and hand you a post-it note saying, "Put the money in the bag." </h1>
